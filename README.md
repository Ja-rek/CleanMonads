It's an implementation of "Maybe" and "Either" monads for C# with extra utils, extensions, and integrations.
The purpose of creating the library was providing the cleanest declarative interface.

The library is not trying to provide "full functional programming style" to C#.
If you looking for something like that check the language-ext.

All the information you need to get started is on the wiki.
